OVERVIEW
========

This is semi-official DAHDI port to FreeBSD.

The following HW drivers are currently ported and tested:
- wct4xxp, including HW echo cancellation support (Octasic)
- wcb4xxp

Drop me an e-mail if you have hardware that is supported by dahdi-linux
but is not supported by this port.

BUILDING
========

Just run "make", then "make install" in directory freebsd/
